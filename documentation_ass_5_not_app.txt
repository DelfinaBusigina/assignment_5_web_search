As my dataset I choose "TikTok Trending Videos" from a free dataset source Kaggle.
I choose this dataset, because it looked interesting and I haven't worked with json files before, usually worked with table format datasets, so this is an interesting challenge.

As my programming language I choose Python. Very popular among Data Engineers.
The libraries are pandas and plotly, since they have a good integration with each other and also allows to create interactive visualization for data.

Pandas is used for data transformation, cleaning and preparation.
Plotly is used for data visualization.

Process of working with the data:

------------- data preparation ---------------
1. Uploaded and loaded the json file
2. Normalized the json when transforming to df, to avoid nesting
3. Checked out all available columns with df.info() command
4. Created a list with new column names, applies the names to df
5. Created new df and choose only needed columns
8a. Transform hashstag list into another df

------------- data analysis --------------
6. Examine each column, its distinct values and count using value_counts()
7. Divide columns which can be grouped and counted, and which not 
Can:
author_id
verified
music_id
music_author
video_duration

Cannot:
id

Can be transformed into range:
time_created
likes_count
shared_count
played_count
comment_count

8. Column hashtag is another list with its own structure and columns, so it will be transformed into second df
9. Create scenarios based on availabel columns
