As my dataset I choose "TikTok Trending Videos" from a free dataset source Kaggle.
I choose this dataset, because it looked interesting and I haven't worked with json files before, usually worked with table format datasets, so this is an interesting challenge.

As my programming language I choose Python. Very popular among Data Engineers.
The libraries are pandas and plotly, since they have a good integration with each other and also allows to create interactive visualization for data.

Pandas is used for data transformation, cleaning and preparation.
Plotly is used for data visualization.

Process of working with the data:
1. Uploaded and loaded the json file
2. Normalized the json when transforming to df, to avoid nesting
3. Checked out all available columns with df.info() command
4. Created a list with new column names, applies the names to df
